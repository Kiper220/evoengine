# EvoEngine

A library for game development in the D programming language.

## Project vision

The library aims to facilitate the process of creating games by providing developers with ready-made solutions for working with graphics, sound and other aspects of the gaming environment.

## Important

At the moment, the project is under development, and it is not recommended to use it until the first stable version is released.

## Future features

 * Writing scripts on D and on Grimoire.
 * Support for both 2D and 3D scenes (in the first stable version, it is planned to support only 2D scenes)
 * Modularity
 * Entity Component System - as the main architectural pattern.
 * Support for Grimoire components and scripts on D and vice versa.
 * Real quick saves and loads.
 * Data replications.
 * Convenient UI construction and the ability to use EvoEngine as a GUI framework
 * And etc... 

## Depencies
 * `dlib` under BSL-1.0 license — a high-level general purpose library for D language intended to game engine developers.
 * `gogga` under LGPL 3.0 license — a simple VT100 colourised pretty-printing logger.
 * `grimoire` under Zlib license — a fast, concurrent based scripting language for D.

## Dependencies for development
 * `silly` under ISC license — a modern and light test runner for the D programming language.
